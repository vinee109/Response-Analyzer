Response Analyzer
=================
created by Vineet Jain, May-August 2013

This project is used to analyze responses for Teacher evaluations. It retrieves data from a survey and categorizes each
comment into a cateogry (eg: Organization, Relationship with Students). It then attaches a positive/negative sentiment
representing that this is something a teacher should continue doing or improve. Based on that the program then generates
a qualitative report that can be distributed to the teacher and other supervising faculty.
